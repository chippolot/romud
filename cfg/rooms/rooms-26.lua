draws attention to a large throne in the center of the room, it seems to be
cut from a single enormous emerald.

shelves which span every wall.  A large oaken writing table is in the center

to your surprise is a quite un-magical oil lamp.

into the wall here there hang several travel worthy cloaks, and a small
leather backpack.  It looks as if someone has prepared this room to be used
in the event speedy of a evacuation.
